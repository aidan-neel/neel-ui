## Update

Neel UI is getting replaced in the following months with a new library that will be more modern, more feature-rich, and more customizable.

You'll still be able to use Neel UI, but it will no longer be maintained or updated. The advantages of the new library is an updated design system, and a more modular approach to creating components.
